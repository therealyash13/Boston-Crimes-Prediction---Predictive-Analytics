# Boston-Crimes-Prediction---Predictive-Analytics
Boston Police Department (BPD) provided high-quality crime incident reports to document initial details of the incidents where BPD officers respond. The main goal of this project is to protect people in the Boston community by identifying crime patterns and predicting the probability of crime occurrences and time with advanced tools in data analytics. In this project, we have implemented the GLM with different aspects and ratios. As a final result observed from our first model, GLM predicted the time of the crimes that mostly happen in Boston with highly improved accuracy and with perfection rate.  Crime incident report is a good reference for those who are new to Boston. Our group is interested in analyzing the crime data to have a better understanding of Boston and offer some helpful safety tips to the people in this community. Our group extracted data about crime incident reports in Boston from Kaggle and build two predictive models. This dataset contains 525,575 observations and 17 features from 2015 to 2020 and includes the types of incidents as well as when and where they occurred. The major data types are characters and numeric values. We will use predictive modeling techniques and evaluation methods on these crime incident report to improve the safety of life.
